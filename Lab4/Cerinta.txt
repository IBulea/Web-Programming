List by using XSLT all bibliography entries (articles, books reports, presentations, web link, software package) from an XML document which correspond to a searching key. This key can be interpreted as an author name, a part from title, publishing year, or editor. The list has to be ordered alphabetically by authors. You should also write a CSS file with at least 6 classes which will be used for displaying the bibliography entries.
